- **When you need it:** EVERY simulation requires this!
- **Example:** "Urban Simulation Engine"

### 💬 DEBATE (Optional but recommended)
- **What it does:** Generates pro/con arguments
- **When you need it:** For running policy debates
- **Example:** "Policy Debate Simulator"

### 📄 AGGREGATOR (Optional but recommended)
- **What it does:** Compiles reports
- **When you need it:** For generating PDF/PowerPoint reports
- **Example:** "Report Aggregator"

### 🎯 SUPERVISOR (Optional)

## Why Do I Need to Add Agents?

**Agents are AI workers that perform specific tasks:**
- **Simulation Agent** = Analyzes your policy
- **Debate Agent** = Argues pro/con
- **Aggregator Agent** = Makes reports

**Think of it like hiring staff for your project!**

You can:
- ✅ Use the same agent in multiple projects
- ✅ Mix and match agents
- ✅ Create custom agents with specific expertise

---

## Troubleshooting:

### "No agents available to add"
**Solution:** All agents are already assigned! You're good to go.

### "I don't see the '+ Add' button"
**Solution:** Scroll down in the right sidebar - it's in the "Assigned Agents" section.

### "Still can't run simulation"
**Solution:** Make sure you have a **SIMULATION** type agent assigned. Check the agent type badge.

## Default Sample Agents:

The system comes with 5 pre-made agents:

1. **Strategic Supervisor** (SUPERVISOR)
2. **Urban Simulation Engine** (SIMULATION) ← You need this one!
3. **Policy Debate Simulator** (DEBATE)
4. **Report Aggregator** (AGGREGATOR)
5. **Communications Generator** (PROPAGANDA)
