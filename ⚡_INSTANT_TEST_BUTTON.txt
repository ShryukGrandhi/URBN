## 🎯 WHAT TO CHECK:

### **In Browser Console (F12):**

After clicking TEST or Run Simulation, look for:
```
📊 Simulation results received: {...}
✅ Simulation completed!
📊 Final simulation data: {...}
```

If you see these logs → Data is working!

If you DON'T see these → Check:
- Backend is running
- WebSocket connected
- No 500 errors

---

## 💡 DEBUGGING TIPS:

### **Map not changing:**
1. Open console (F12)
2. Look for red errors
3. Check if `simulationResults` is set
4. Try clicking TEST button instead

### **No heatmap visible:**
1. Make sure you clicked TEST or ran simulation
2. Check zoom level (14-16 works best)
3. Look for console logs
4. Try toggling heatmap ON/OFF

### **No markers appearing:**
1. Zoom in closer (zoom 15-16)
2. Pan around to find them
3. Check console for errors
